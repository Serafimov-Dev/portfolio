          Although I am just starting out in frontend development and do not yet
          have completed projects, with this portfolio I want to show what I can
          do.
          <br />
          The main focus of my portfolio is a gallery of graphic designs created
          by me over the last 10 years as a hobby or for direct clients. The
          gallery loads data from an external JSON with fetch and useEffect and
          allows filtering by categories. When clicked, a modal opens with a
          detailed overview and navigation via arrows, keyboard and gestures.
          When the modal is open, scrolling is blocked to maintain focus.
